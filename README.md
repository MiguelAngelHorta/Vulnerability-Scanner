Scan the following vulnerable web targets for educational purposes:
1. http://testphp.vulnweb.com/
2. http://testasp.vulnweb.com/
3. http://testaspnet.vulnweb.com/
4. http://testcgi.vulnweb.com/
5. http://testasp.vulnweb.com/


# Summary
Vulnerabilities are found by analyzing the response text from the requested URLs. If any predefined keywords indicating potential vulnerabilities are found in the response text, the script identifies and records them. Additionally, any errors encountered during the scanning process (e.g., connection errors) are also considered potential vulnerabilities and are recorded accordingly.
  
- import flask, import requests: Imports the Flask framework for creating a web application and the Requests library for making HTTP requests.
- app = flask.Flask(name): Initializes a Flask application.
- vulnerabilities = []: Initializes an empty list to store detected vulnerabilities.
- def scan_website(url): This function takes a URL as input, sends an HTTP GET request to that URL, and then analyzes the response. If the response contains certain keywords indicative of potential vulnerabilities (such as "error" or "invalid"), it appends information about the vulnerability to the vulnerabilities list. If an error occurs during the request (e.g., connection error), it also records that as a potential vulnerability.
- @app.route("/"): Decorates the dashboard() function to be called when the root URL ("/") is accessed.
- def dashboard(): This function generates a dashboard displaying information about detected vulnerabilities. It counts the number of vulnerabilities by severity level and renders a template to display the vulnerabilities and severity counts.
- if name == "main":: This block of code is executed only if the script is run directly (not imported as a module). It prompts the user to input a URL to scan, then calls the scan_website() function with the provided URL. Finally, it starts the Flask application, enabling access to the dashboard.
